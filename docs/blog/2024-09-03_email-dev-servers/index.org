* Development email servers

This is a collection of development email servers. Such servers can be used to develop and test
programs that need to send outgoing email. They work by providing an SMTP server that "traps"
all outgoing emails and instead of sending them to the recipient address, it presents them
in a custom inbox.

The servers listed are split in two sections. In the recommended section are servers that fullfil
the following criteria: Easy to configure, Provides docker images, Supports TLS.

** Recommended

- [[https://github.com/maildev/maildev][maildev]] - Resizable viewport, You must provide the certs yourself.
